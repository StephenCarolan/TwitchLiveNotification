# TwitchLiveNotification

Twitch's built-in live notifications are very slow, and can be anywhere from a few to 30 minutes late.

This simple python program uses Twitch's API to check the live status of a list of streamers, and send an
email notification when they go live.

Requires:
Gmail account (two accounts recommended as sender requires "less secure app access")
Twtich api access (see their website)
